# 🎵 Music App

This project is a music application that combines a Laravel backend, a Vue.js frontend client, and a Python auxiliary server for specific tasks. The entire project is dockerized and can be easily started with `docker-compose up`.

This app is inspired by Spotify, just for development purposes.

### Key Points:
1. **Syntax highlighting**: Each code block specifies the language (e.g., `bash`, `plaintext`, `yaml`).
2. **Inline commands**: Used single backticks (`) for inline code snippets, like `docker-compose restart`.
3. **Customizable**: Replace placeholders like `your-username` and `your-email@example.com` with your actual details.

This version will render nicely on GitHub! 🚀
